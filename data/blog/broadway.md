summary: 'Dinner at Broadway by Amar Santana in Laguna Beach, California.'

I had an awesome date night to celebrate 9 months with my girlfriend at Broadway by Amar Santana in Laguna Beach, CA.
We made reservations for 5:00pm on a Saturday night which gave us the opportunity to sit by the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare our food.

We started the night with Spanish Octopus garnished with potatoes, pickled peppers, black olive yogurt, and romesco. The dish had two huge pieces of octopus that were full of flavor, soft, and buttery. I would definitely order this again, but also want to try the bone marrow next time.

I ordered the Miso Marinated Chilean Seabass as my main dish and it did not disappoint. It was so soft and rich in flavor that I could not stop eating it. The forbidden rice (those black spheres of goodness) added a nice contrast to the soft seabass; it was like ["nooroongji"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_rice#Korea). I think this would be my go-to dish.

For her main dish, May ordered the Grilled Marinated Prime Skirt Steak, cooked medium. It came with roasted potatoes, green peppers, caramalized onion jus sauce, and chimichurri sauce. May fed me several fork-fulls of steak, potato, and pepper together and I found myself wanting more and more bites. We both highly recommend the skirt steak.

For our drinks, we asked our waittress for recommendations: Per√∫by (left) and Song of the Summer 2021 (right). Both cocktails were delicious and paired well with our dishes throughout the evening.

The service was exceptional. The flow of food that came from the kitchen was perfect and we were definitely taken care of.
